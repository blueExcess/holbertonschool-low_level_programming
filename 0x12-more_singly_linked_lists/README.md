# More singly linked lists
## issues:
 - General: why does calling x->next more than once result in segfault? If at end of list, shouldn't calls be redundant?
 - 6: not sure about return value for non-existant list
 - 7: not returning NULL if exceeding number of nodes in list
 - 9: segfault if idx = 0 or idx > no. of nodes

Ta Dah!
